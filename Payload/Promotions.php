 * You can add one or more promotions when creating or updating an order.
 * You can also separately add promotions to the account via the `add_promotion` event.»

 * 3) «The Promotion field type generically models different kinds of promotions
 * such as referrals, coupons, free trials, etc.
 * The value must be a nested JSON object
 * which you populate with the appropriate information to describe the promotion.
 * Not all sub-fields will likely apply to a given promotion. Populate only those that apply.
 * A promotion can be added when creating or updating an account, creating or updating an order,
 * or on its own using the `add_promotion` event.
 * The promotion object supports both monetary (e.g. $25 coupon on first order)
 * and non-monetary (e.g. "1000 in game points to refer a friend").»
